# --------- DEFINE EXPERIMENT PARAMETERS ---------- #

# Define target for prediction.
target = 'Which 5 items are most important to you in your daily life? Please indicate these in order of importance, starting with the most important_Motorcycle'

                 'Given the chosen climate event - which 3 items are most useful to you?']
