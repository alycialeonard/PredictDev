# --------- DEFINE EXPERIMENT PARAMETERS ---------- #

# Define target for prediction.
target = 'Which of the following items do you have access to in your daily life?_Electricity'

# Define short-form of target to use in file saving
target_short = 'access_electricity'

# Define questions to drop from predictors
stems_to_drop = ['Which of the following items do you have access to in your daily life?',
                 'What is the main source of lighting?',
