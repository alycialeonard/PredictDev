Omit item access and item value questions in case of correlation with phone ownership.

# --------- DEFINE EXPERIMENT PARAMETERS ---------- #

# Define target for prediction.
target = 'annotation_Connection'

# Define short-form of target to use in file saving
target_short = 'annotation_connection'

# Define questions to drop from predictors
stems_to_drop = ['annotation_',
                 'Of these appliances which is the most valuable?'
                 'Which of the following items do you have access to in your daily life?',
                 'Which 5 items are most important to you in your daily life? Please indicate these in order of importance, starting with the most important',
                 'Given the chosen climate event - which 3 items are most useful to you?']
