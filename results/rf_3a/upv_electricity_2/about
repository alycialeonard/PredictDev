# --------- DEFINE EXPERIMENT PARAMETERS ---------- #

# Define target for prediction.
target = 'Which 5 items are most important to you in your daily life? Please indicate these in order of importance, starting with the most important_Electricity'

# Define short-form of target to use in file saving
target_short = 'upv_electricity_2'

# Define questions to drop from predictors
stems_to_drop = ['Which of the following items do you have access to in your daily life?',
                 'What is the main source of lighting?',
                 'What is the main source of electricity in your home?',
                 'What is the electricity used for?',
                 'What do you use electricity for in your business?',
                 'Which 5 items are most important to you in your daily life? Please indicate these in order of importance, starting with the most important',
                 'Given the chosen climate event - which 3 items are most useful to you?']
