Looking at annotations of "multipurpose" as these are the most common on electricity.
However, I suspect they'll be noisy - by nature of the value and its broad meaning.

Drop all other annotations.

Yep, it performs bad, but that's expected.

# --------- DEFINE EXPERIMENT PARAMETERS ---------- #

# Define target for prediction.
target = 'annotation_Multipurpose'

# Define short-form of target to use in file saving
target_short = 'annotation_multipurpose'

# Define questions to drop from predictors
stems_to_drop = ['annotation_']
