Interesting to compare to water - similar prioritistaion, but I hypothesise it will be more specific.
Dropping other general/climate UPV columns

Verdict - nope, basically the same as water in the end!


# --------- DEFINE EXPERIMENT PARAMETERS ---------- #

# Define target for prediction.
target = 'Which 5 items are most important to you in your daily life? Please indicate these in order of importance, starting with the most important_Borehole'

# Define short-form of target to use in file saving
target_short = 'upv_borehole'

# Define questions to drop from predictors
stems_to_drop = ['Which 5 items are most important to you in your daily life? Please indicate these in order of importance, starting with the most important',
                 'Given the chosen climate event - which 3 items are most useful to you?']
