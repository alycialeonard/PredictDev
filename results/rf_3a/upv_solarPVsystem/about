One more kick at the cat - let's try the next electric item after battery.
Drop all the other general upv/climate columns

Maybe more predictable than battery based on those who already own?
Actually worse!

# --------- DEFINE EXPERIMENT PARAMETERS ---------- #

# Define target for prediction.
target = 'Which 5 items are most important to you in your daily life? Please indicate these in order of importance, starting with the most important_Solar PV System'

# Define short-form of target to use in file saving
target_short = 'upv_solarPVsystem'

# Define questions to drop from predictors
stems_to_drop = ['Which 5 items are most important to you in your daily life? Please indicate these in order of importance, starting with the most important',
                 'Given the chosen climate event - which 3 items are most useful to you?']
