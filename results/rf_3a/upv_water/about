Testing water - high UPV, argue water/energy nexus being tested (i.e., multipurpose on electricity often refers to water pumping. )
Omit general/climate UPV

I feel like a lot of different people prioritise water for different reasons - maybe this will be noisy too?
Yep! But performs pretty well. Thing is everyone needs water, it's a basic of life. Also subjective.

# --------- DEFINE EXPERIMENT PARAMETERS ---------- #

# Define target for prediction.
target = 'Which 5 items are most important to you in your daily life? Please indicate these in order of importance, starting with the most important_Water'

# Define short-form of target to use in file saving
target_short = 'upv_water'

# Define questions to drop from predictors
stems_to_drop = ['Which 5 items are most important to you in your daily life? Please indicate these in order of importance, starting with the most important',
                 'Given the chosen climate event - which 3 items are most useful to you?']
