Modelling irrigation for climate UPV game
Relatively well-selected electrifiable technology during climate shock
Dropping other UPV responses (general and climate)

Bad performance on positives + overfitting - limited data on positives, probably no real correlations.

# Define target for prediction.
target = 'Given the chosen climate event - which 3 items are most useful to you?_Irrigation'

# Define short-form of target to use in file saving
